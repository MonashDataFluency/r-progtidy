These are the course notes for the [Monash Data Fluency](https://www.monash.edu/data-fluency)'s "Programming and Tidy data analysis in R" course. This is an intermediate level R workshop, for people wishing to increase their fluency in R. It covers tasks that while not specifically involved in statistical analysis are necessary when working with data: loading data and getting it into a form that is easy to work with, automating repetitive tasks, identifying problems such as the need for normalization and transformation, and properly understanding the story the data wants to tell.

## Ways to run R and RStudio

We will be using a training server with everything already set up. Unfortunately we aren't able to offer accounts on this server that will last more than a few days. In the longer term, some options when using R are:

* Install [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) on your laptop. This gives maximum freedom to tinker. There are sometimes problems to work around when using work-supplied laptops.

* Use [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/). This is a currently free service by the RStudio corporation. This is a very easy way to get started!

* Use a Docker image such as [`rocker/rstudio`](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned/blob/master/rstudio/README.md) or `rocker/tidyverse` on a cloud service such as the [NECTAR](https://nectar.org.au/) research cloud, [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/), or [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/). This allows use of machines with larger memory and more CPU cores. It's also a route to making reproducible and readily sharable working environments, including software external to R.

Once R and RStudio are running, you can get set up for this workshop with this R code:

```{r eval=F}
download.file(
    "https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-progtidy/r-progtidy-files.zip",
    destfile="r-progtidy-files.zip")
unzip("r-progtidy-files.zip")

install.packages(c("tidyverse", "devtools", "roxygen2"))
```

Some parts of the workshop use the external software [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) as an example. Exactly how to install this differs between operating systems. The following will install FastQC in RStudio Cloud:

```{r eval=F}
download.file(
    "https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/fastqc_v0.11.8.zip",
    destfile="fastqc.zip")
unzip("fastqc.zip")
system("chmod 755 FastQC/fastqc")

# Test that it works
system("FastQC/fastqc -h")

# In the workshop, you will need to replace uses of:
#    system("fastqc ...")
# with:
#    system("FastQC/fastqc ...")
```

We recommend [using projects](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects) in RStudio to organize your files.
