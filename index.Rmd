These are the course notes for the [Monash Data Fluency](https://www.monash.edu/data-fluency)'s "Programming and Tidy data analysis in R" course. This is an intermediate level R workshop, for people wishing to increase their fluency in R. It covers tasks that while not specifically involved in statistical analysis are necessary when working with data: loading data and getting it into a form that is easy to work with, automating repetitive tasks, identifying problems such as the need for normalization and transformation, and properly understanding the story the data wants to tell.

## Files

* [r-progtidy-files.zip](r-progtidy-files.zip) - files used in this course

## Slides

* [Introduction](slides/introduction.html) ([.Rmd](slides/introduction.Rmd))

## Topics

* [Programming](topics/programming.html) ([.Rmd](topics/programming.Rmd))
* [The Tidyverse: dplyr, ggplot2, and friends](topics/tidyverse.html) ([.Rmd](topics/tidyverse.Rmd))

## Setup

This workshop is designed to work with [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/). Go to https://rstudio.cloud/ (Monash users can log in with their Monash google account) and create a new project.

Running the R code below will download files and install packages used in this workshop. This should also work for R used locally, excepting that to use [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) you will need to have installed Java, and the FastQC steps will probably need some adjustments for Windows computers (this isn't an essential part of the workshop).

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Download workshop files
download.file(
    "https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-progtidy/r-progtidy-files.zip",
    "r-progtidy-files.zip")
unzip("r-progtidy-files.zip")

# Download FastQC software
download.file(
    "https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/fastqc_v0.11.8.zip",
    "fastqc_v0.11.8.zip")
unzip("fastqc_v0.11.8.zip")
system("chmod u+x FastQC/fastqc")

# Install Tidyverse packages
install.packages("tidyverse")


# Optional: install some further packages 
# (these are mentioned but not essential to the workshop)
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("usethis")
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("edgeR")
```
