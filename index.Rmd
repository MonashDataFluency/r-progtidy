These are the course notes for the [Monash Data Fluency](https://www.monash.edu/data-fluency)'s "Programming and Tidy data analysis in R" course.
This builds on our ["Introduction to R"](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-intro-2/) course. 

The topics covered today will make you more productive in R. You will be able to automate repetitive tasks, and able to tackle more complicated data analysis.
