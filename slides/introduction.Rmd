## R more

<img src="../figures/Rlogo.png" style="float: right">

Today will be a fast tour of modern R.

* R is a moving target

* Focus on "Tidyverse" 
  * `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, etc
  *  Mostly written by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/)

<br>

S - 1976

R - 1993


## Working with data today is

### Exploratory

Complex experimental designs, large $n$ and/or large $p$.

Understanding is a cyclic process of exploratation.

### Integrative

In biology you may want to join together many different views of a process: DNA, RNA, epigenetics, proteins, metabolome, cell morphology, ...

Your data can be viewed in the context of many other data sets.

<br>
In biology, reference genome and gene annotations are the key to joining different types of data.


## Analysis cycle

### Load, tidy, normalize and transform data

* Tidy data makes visualization and modelling fast and easy.
* Correctly normalized and transformed data brings out the signal in visualizations, and necessary for correct modelling.

**Key packages:** readr, tidyr, dplyr

### Visualization, exploration

*The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us 
<br>to notice what we never expected to see.*

-- John Tukey

* Suggests the need for normalization or transformation.
* Shows if any of the data is poor quality.
* Shows unexpected things in the data.
* Informs what relationships are important in the data for any modelling and statistical testing.

**Key packages:** ggplot2, shiny

### Summarization, modelling, statistical testing

* Shrinks large data sets for more manageable visualization.
* Confirm what can be seen in visualization, tells us what *isn't* real.
* What hypotheses does the data support and reject?
* Failures should prompt a rethink of normalization and tranformation, and further visualization to understand the data.

**Key packages:** dplyr

**Base R functions:** mean, min, max, sd, lm, glm, anova, ...

**Specialized packages:** too many to name

<br>
**Note:** Model fitting and hypothesis testing won't be covered today.


## Tidy data is key

Tidy data doesn't mean tidy for a person to read, it means the easiest form for the computer to work with.

* only use data frames
* each row is a single unit of observation
* each column is a single piece of information
* each column is a distinct kind of information

Similar to database design.

The experimental design is in the body of the table alongside the data, *not* in row names or column names.

## Not tidy ...

Example from: [Wickham, H. (2015) Tidy data. The Journal of Statistical Software, vol. 59.](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html)

## ... tidier ... tidy

## Programming (scripting)

If every step of your analysis is recorded in an R script, with no manual steps:

* you have a complete record of what you have done
* easy to run entire script with test data
* changes easily tested, poor early decisions easily fixed
* today's big project becomes tomorrow's building block

<!--
Elements of programming we will be looking at today:

* re-usable step-by-step procedures with `function`
* doing something "for each ..." with `for` loops
* making decisions with `if`
* running external software with `system`
* running all the code in a .R file as a "script", or to load a "library" of functions
-->

## Best practices

<img src="../figures/remember-kids.jpg" style="position: absolute; right: 0px; top: 0px;" height="400">

Open, reproducable data science.

Show your code. It may surprise you who picks it up and runs with it.

* Document analysis in Rmarkdown

* Ultimately, share useful functions in R packages
    * Version control (eg git, GitHub or GitLab)
    * Tutorial and reference documentation
    * Testing
    * `devtools::check`

<br>

* For reproducibility, record which versions of packages you used 
    * `sessionInfo()`
