R has a long history.

* S - 1976
* R - 1993

We will be focussing on the modern "Tidyverse" approach. 

* `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, `purrr`, etc
* data frame ("tibble") is the one true data structure
* mostly written by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/)
* safer and less "helpful"
   * less edge cases (eg same data type produced with 1 and many items)
   * abort with error on unexpected input

Data analysis isn't just statistical modelling.

*The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us 
<br>to notice what we never expected to see.*

## Topics covered today

Communication and modelling covered in other workshops.


## Programming (scripting)

If every step of your analysis is recorded in an R script, with no manual steps:

* you have a complete record of what you have done
* easy to run entire script with test data
* changes easily tested, poor early decisions easily fixed
* today's big project becomes tomorrow's building block

<!--
Elements of programming we will be looking at today:

* re-usable step-by-step procedures with `function`
* doing something "for each ..." with `for` loops
* making decisions with `if`
* running external software with `system`
* running all the code in a .R file as a "script", or to load a "library" of functions
-->

## Data

As your programs get more complicated, you will also need ways to represent complex data.

R data types are a bit different from those in other languages, such as Python or Javascript. Translating data structures from one of these languages, often the solution will be to use a "list".


## Data

### Vectors

Vectors are a collection of a single kind of data.

Unlike other languages, single numbers are a vector of length 1.

Vectors can have `names( )`.

### Lists

Lists are a special kind of vector that can hold any kind of data, including other vectors and lists.

If you need to bundle together a miscelaneous collection of data, lists are your solution. For example, a function that needs to return multiple results can return a list.

Lists play the same role as both the `list` and `dict` types in Python or objects in Javascript.

Access individual elements with `[[ ]]`.

## Data

### Matrices

Matrices hold tabular data all of the same type.

These are important for linear maths, but we won't be using them today.

### Data frames (tibbles)

Data frames hold tabular data where the columns may be different types. 

Under the hood, they are a list of column vectors. 

### Other classes

There are various other classes for specialized purposes. In R, these are usually lists with a `class( )` attribute that marks them as special. These are called "S3" classes. You can manipulate them like lists, but there will also be various other functions that can be used with them.

Not covered today: Bioconductor uses "S4" classes, which are different.



## Tidy data

Tidy data doesn't mean tidy for a person to read, it means the easiest form for the computer to work with.

* only use data frames
* each row is a single unit of observation
* each column is a single piece of information
* each column is a distinct kind of information

Similar to database design.

The experimental design is in the body of the table alongside the data, *not* in row names or column names.

## Not tidy ...

Example from: [Wickham, H. (2015) Tidy data. The Journal of Statistical Software, vol. 59.](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html)
