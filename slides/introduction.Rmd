R has a long history.

* S - 1976
* R - 1993

We will be focussing on the modern [Tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org) approach. 

* `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, `purrr`, etc
* data frame ("tibble") is the one true data structure
* mostly written by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/)
* simpler, safer, and less "helpful"
   * less edge cases (eg same data type produced with 1 and many items)
   * abort with error on unexpected input

Data analysis isn't just statistical modelling.

*The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us 
<br>to notice what we never expected to see.*

## Topics covered today

Communication and modelling covered in other workshops.


## Programming, from a scientist's perspective

If every step of your analysis is recorded in an R script, with no manual steps:

* you have a complete record of what you have done
* easy to run entire script with test data
* changes easily tested, poor early decisions easily fixed
* today's big project becomes a function in a package, serves as tomorrow's building block

<br>
Programming is an essential part of **reproducible research**.

* other researchers can precisely understand and verify your work

<!--
Elements of programming we will be looking at today:

* re-usable step-by-step procedures with `function`
* doing something "for each ..." with `for` loops
* making decisions with `if`
* running external software with `system`
* running all the code in a .R file as a "script", or to load a "library" of functions
-->


## Data

As your programs get more complicated, you will also need ways to represent complex data.

Often the largest task is to get the data into the right form to apply a tool such as `ggplot`, `summarize`, or `lm`.


## Data

### Vectors

* A collection of a single kind of data:<br>numeric, character, factor, logical
* Single numbers are a vector of length 1.
* Can have `names( )`.

### Lists

* A special kind of vector that can hold any kind of data, including other vectors and lists.
* If you need to bundle together a miscelaneous collection of data, lists are your solution. For example, a function that needs to return multiple results can return a list.
* Play the same role as both the `list` and `dict` types in Python or objects in Javascript.
* Access individual elements with `[[ ]]` or `$`.

## Data

### Data frames

* Data frames hold tabular data where the columns may be different types. 
* Under the hood, a list of column vectors. 
* Tidyverse has an improved data frame called a "tibble".

### Others (not covered today)

* **Matrices** hold tabular data all of the same type, usually numeric.<br>Distinct from data frames in R!<br>Can have `rownames( )` and `colnames( )`.

* **"S3" objects** are (usually) a list, with a special class attribute.<br>Example: an **lm** object holding a linear model.

* **"S4" objects** are a more formal approach to object-orientation.<br>Most heavily used by the Bioconductor project.<br>Example: a `GRanges` object holding genomic ranges.



## Tidy data

Tidy data doesn't mean tidy for a person to read, it means the easiest form for the computer to work with.

* only use data frames
* each row is a single unit of observation
* each column is a single piece of information
* each column is a distinct kind of information

Similar to database design.

The experimental design is in the body of the table alongside the data, *not* in row names or column names.

## Not tidy ...

Example from: [Wickham, H. (2015) Tidy data. The Journal of Statistical Software, vol. 59.](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html)
