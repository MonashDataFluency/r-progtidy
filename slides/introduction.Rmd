R has a long history.

* S - 1976
* R - 1993

We will be focussing on the modern "Tidyverse" approach. 

* `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, `purrr`, etc
* Data frame ("tibble") is the one true data structure
* Mostly written by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/)
* Safer and less "helpful"
   * less edge cases (eg same data type produced with 1 and many items)
   * abort with error on unexpected input


## Analysis cycle

From [The "R for Data Science" book](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

Data analysis isn't just statistical modelling.

*The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us 
<br>to notice what we never expected to see.*

-- John Tukey


## Topics covered today

Communication and modelling covered in other workshops.


## Programming (scripting)

If every step of your analysis is recorded in an R script, with no manual steps:

* you have a complete record of what you have done
* easy to run entire script with test data
* changes easily tested, poor early decisions easily fixed
* today's big project becomes tomorrow's building block

<!--
Elements of programming we will be looking at today:

* re-usable step-by-step procedures with `function`
* doing something "for each ..." with `for` loops
* making decisions with `if`
* running external software with `system`
* running all the code in a .R file as a "script", or to load a "library" of functions
-->


## Tidy data

Tidy data doesn't mean tidy for a person to read, it means the easiest form for the computer to work with.

* only use data frames
* each row is a single unit of observation
* each column is a single piece of information
* each column is a distinct kind of information

Similar to database design.

The experimental design is in the body of the table alongside the data, *not* in row names or column names.

## Not tidy ...

Example from: [Wickham, H. (2015) Tidy data. The Journal of Statistical Software, vol. 59.](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html)
